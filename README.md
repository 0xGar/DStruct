# DStruct
(Project discontinued)

Vanilla JavaScript single-page application library based on web components.

The motivation behind this project larglely came from React / Redux's handing of data. But instead of a global store, this library "glues" and "unglues" data (intended to be from an API) to web components. When the data is updated, all relevant "glued" web components will be notified and updated (somewhat like React context).
